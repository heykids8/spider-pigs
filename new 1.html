  <h3>Mental Health</h3>
  <p>The wellness of a human being is compiled of the balance of mental, emotional, and physical health. But, when the balance is disrupted, it can lead to damage to the wellbeing of a person, whether it be emotionally unstable, physically disabled, or mentally unsteady. Anyone can go through any of these. Here's another thing, mental health doesn't just include depression, there's insomnia, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, post traumatic stress disorder, dissociative identity disorder, cotard delusion, depersonalization disorder, and many more.

<div id="Media" class="tabcontent">
  <h3>Media</h3>
  <p> The media. It is not just social media. It is portrayed in literature, musicals, tv shows, movies, video games, etc. Mental health is starting to become more and more depicted in media. This doesn't mean that mental health is represented in an accurate way. What we have here is different 
  pieces of media interpreting mental health in a somewhat accurate way. On social media, cyberbullying is a major issue, and the fact that some bullies are anonymous makes it seem that the whole world is against the victim. This will make the victim believe they don't belong, and can make 
  them commit self-harm or even suicide. Also, violent games can cause some people to think that the game is real, and they start to cause damage to themselves, their family, and even their world.

<div id="Sleep" class="tabcontent">
  <h3>Sleep</h3>
  <p>
  Sleep is also very important to any person. Sleep deprivation is very serious. You grow in your sleep, so, basically sleep is like a battery your body uses to charge. Think about a phone. When a phone does not charge, it can't function. When you do not sleep, you can't function. See the similarities? Sleep is so vital to mental health. One example is, if someone has PTSD, they are most likely to have the symptom, night terrors.

<div id="Drugs/Alcohol" class="tabcontent">
  <h3>Drugs/Alcohol</h3>
  <p>  Drugs and alcohol are very bad for you. They can make you hallucinate and could get you sick. Drugs have a ton of side effects that are bad for you. Alcohol makes you drunk and also too much of it really can harm you. 300 people in Illinois die drunk in car crashes every year. As we grow as a community together, drug and alcohol abuse is killing several thousands everyday.  </p>

  <h3>Different Pieces of Media, Different Mental Illnesses</h3>
  <p>PIECES OF MEDIA THAT INCLUDE PEOPLE WHO STRUGGLE WITH MENTAL ILLNESSES:

MUSICALS-

Dear Evan Hansen: Dear Evan Hansen is about a high schooler, Evan Hansen dealing with severe social anxiety. And through a big misunderstanding, becomes entangled with the aftermath and story of his classmate, Connor Murphy’s suicide, while also allowing him to gain his own sense of purpose. In this cast of characters, we really get to see how different people are in our ever-changing society, and how people will cope differently compared to others. 
4/5 notes.

Next To Normal: This musical centers around a distraught family and their ways to deal with the mother’s bipolar disorder. The music and dialogue also mainly centers around the family and the different ways that they’ve coped with the death of their son/brother. The musical also addresses the issues of grief, suicide, drug abuse, ethics in modern psychiatry of suburban life.     
5/5 notes.

TV SHOWS-

BoJack Horseman: BoJack Horseman is lost in a sea of self-loathing and booze. Once the star of a '90s sitcom, he decides it's time for a comeback. The show was the hottest thing around, then suddenly, was canceled. Now, 18 years later, BoJack wants to regain his dignity. Hollywood is vastly different from the past days, and getting used to social media will take some time. With plenty of references to sex, drugs, and alcohol, the animated series does an impressively good job at portraying depression, anxiety, and addiction better than a number of other TV shows out there at the moment. 
5/5 notes.

MOVIES- 

Iron Man 3: After the events of The Avengers, also dubbed as the Battle of New York, Tony Stark falls into the pit of PTSD, post-traumatic stress disorder. Constantly in the state of feeling unsafe, anxious, and alone. His PTSD also causes him to develop depression, anxiety, night terrors, insomnia, and an unhealthy way of coping with his PTSD. Through the movie, you see Mr. Stark’s personal battle with his mental illness. In the end, you get to see how Tony Stark blowing up all of his new and old Iron Man suits isn’t showing that he is not Iron Man anymore, it’s symbolizing that’s he has won his personal battle with his mental illness. 
4.5/5 notes. 

Split: “Split” describes the life of a person dealing with dissociative identity disorder — a battle between multiple personalities. The movie depicts the story of a man diagnosed with the said disorder. Kevin, the main character, has 23 different personalities. The storyline of the movie involves a battle between those personalities, his therapist and the three teenage girls whom he abducts at the beginning of the movie. 
3/5 notes. 

VIDEO GAMES-

Night in the Woods: Mae, our main protagonist, is a fresh college dropout, she comes back to her old hometown to visit her family and old friends, but she notices, that not everything was how it used to be. Night in the Woods' portrayal of mental health tells us all that, it’s ok not feel so good sometimes. This games also reminds about the fact, that we all valid. Night in the Woods teaches us about how we can face our inner demons and insecurities but also gives us a really well-made game and a fun gameplay, as well as a compelling story. 
5/5 notes.

That Dragon, Cancer: The autobiographical game is based on a family’s experience of raising their son Joel, who was diagnosed with terminal cancer at twelve months old, and though only given a short time to live, continued to survive for four more years before eventually passing away due to cancer in March 2014. The game is designed to use the medium's interactivity and immersion in the in ways that a film cannot. The game also tells the story of the parents and their depression and ways to cope with their son’s death. 
4.5/5 notes. 

BOOKS-

It’s Kind of a Funny Story: “It's so hard to talk when you want to kill yourself", is one of the best attention-grabbing first lines of any book I’ve ever read. Though Craig Gilner was accepted to Manhattan's highly competitive Executive Pre-Professional High School, during his first year there he grows increasingly overwhelmed. His staggering and overbearing stress isn’t helped by his new habit of smoking pot. Unable to eat and seriously considering suicide, Craig checks himself into a psychiatric hospital. Craig and his exhilarating recovery goes to show us that, any block that comes in your way, there’s always a way to cope, think, explore, solve, and even change that problem. The author, Ned Vizzini clearly has not lost his knack for conveying the textures of teenage life. 
5/5 notes.
